# UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1 Backdoor

This is a python version of a metasploit module that exploits a known vulnerability in UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1

I know that this exploit is already well documented and easy to perform with a metasploit module but I wanted to work on my python scripting knowledge, (specifically interacting with sockets in python), and thought this would be a good way to start.

Please let me know where the code could be improved upon, or if there is a completely different way to go about it thats better.
